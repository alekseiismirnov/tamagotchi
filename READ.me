- Check on the pet and see how it's doing - is it still alive?!?
- Feed it
- Play with it
- Put it to sleep

- The home page should list all Tamagotchi names, and 
- users should be able to click on a Tamagotchi to see a detail view page with that pet's information and levels. 

Make sure to include integration testing for these new 'paths' users can travel.

For the time being, it's fine if time only passes and depletes Tamagotchi levels 
while a user is viewing an individual Tamagotchi.
